## How the project was born

With the problem of always having to send list after list on whatsApp groups with people having to copy the list, add their name and resend it, i came up with the idead of creating a list organizer but aiming towards the soccer theme.

The project was kickstarted using lovable, an AI code generator. Then i added a few features, google Maps API and Supabase Auth.
