## Project info

**URL**: https://futevento.com.br

## How the project was born

With the problem of always having to send list after list on whatsApp groups with people having to copy the list, add their name and resend it, i came up with the idead of creating a list organizer but aiming towards the soccer theme.

The project was kickstarted using lovable, an AI code generator. Then i added a few features, google Maps API and Supabase Auth.

## How it works

1. A user can create a list of events, add a location and a date. Then they can share the list with others via link.

2. When someone clicks on the link, they can see details about the event including the location on the map.

3. The user can add their name to the list and the list will be updated automatically.

4. The user can also see the list of people who are going to the event.

5. The creator of the list can see the list of people who are going and copy the list to clipboard, to paste on whatsApp.
